# Randomized dimension reduction methods for text data visualization

This is the repo for Couran's spring 2022: Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra. What's included:

    - DataGeneration.py: section in which data was scrapped out from Facebook comments from major Mexican news sites
    - errorPlots.py: section for plotting different graphs related to the project
    - function_implementation: main section, here are the implementation of the different methods decribed in the papers
    - PrepData.py: section for data prepping + processing
    - test.py: tests on various things, not crucial por the project
    - Visualizations.py: implementations of function_implementation.py for this particular data set
  
All the graphs that were made through this process can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dPcuNpr9jdQCr4dJNrebo59CupBgQgM2?usp=sharing
